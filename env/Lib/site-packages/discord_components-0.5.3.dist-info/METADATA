## Welcome!
Discord components are cool, but discord.py will support it on version 2.0. It is hard to wait, so we made a third-party library for using components such as buttons or selects!  We're currently developing this library, so it has a lot of bugs. But it has enough features to make the components easy to use :)

This project is open source ‚≠ê.

Also, there is an [official discord server](https://discord.gg/pKM6stqPxS), so if you have a question, feel free to ask it on this server.

## Features
+ You can use discord components and handle interactions easily!
+ Methods based on discord.py.
+ Supports discord.ext.commands, and going to support [discord-py-slash-command](https://discord-py-slash-command.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Docs
[The docs](https://devkiki7000.gitbook.io/discord-components/) could contain many grammatic errors, spelling mistakes, and typos because I am not a native English speaker. So if there is a problem on the docs, contact me or create an issue.

## Install
```
pip install --upgrade discord-components
```

## Example
```py
from discord.ext.commands import Bot
from discord_components import DiscordComponents, Button

bot = Bot(command_prefix = "your prefix")


@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    DiscordComponents(bot)
    print(f"Logged in as {bot.user}!")


@bot.command()
async def button(ctx):
    await ctx.send(
        "Hello, World!",
        components = [
            Button(label = "WOW button!")
        ]
    )

    interaction = await bot.wait_for("button_click", check = lambda i: i.component.label.startswith("WOW"))
    await interaction.respond(content = "Button clicked!")


bot.run("your token")
```
